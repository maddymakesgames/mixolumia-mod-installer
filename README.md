# Mixolumia Mod Installer
Install mixolumia palettes and music packs easier! <br>
Installs .mxmusic, .mxpalette, and .mxmod files.

## Usage
`./mixolumia_mod_installer [mxmod / mxmusic / mxpalette file]`<br>
Or you can just run mixolumia_mod_installer.exe once and it will set it up so that whenever you open a supported file it will install it.

## Installation
### Windows
Just run mixolumia_mod_installer.exe once and it will register itself as the handler of mod file types.<br>
If you move mixolumia_mod_installer.exe you will need to re-run the app to update the registry.

### Mac
Drag Mixolumia Mod Installer.app into your applications folder and it will register itself as the handler of mod files.

## File formats
This program uses 3 special file formats mxmod, mxmusic, and mxpalette<br>
Information about these formats can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/maddymakesgames/mixolumia-mod-installer/wiki)

## Planned features
- [x] Allow quick installation of music packs and palettes
- [x] Autoassign mixolumia-mod-installer as the default way to open its file formats
  - [X] Support file extension opening on Mac
- [ ] Allow texture mods via editing the data.win file
- [ ] Allow string edits via editing mixolumia.exe


## Note about mac
While mac is technically supported I don't have access to a mac so I can't distribute mac builds and can't test mac-specific code<br>
If anyone would like to contribute to help with the mac code that would be very much appreciated
